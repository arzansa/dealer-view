<h1>Dealer View</h1>
<p>Dealer View is a proof-of-concept for a used car dealership website. The website allows an authenticated user to update the inventory on the website with ease. This makes it simple for a dealer to update their inventory without much technical know-how.</p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

![Picture of a Sign Up page](https://i.imgur.com/A1wn7ul.png)

<p>Anyone can view the inventory by clicking the corresponding button without needing to be logged in. A user can create an account by clicking the sign up button, and use the log in button in the future to access admin features.</p>

<h2>Editing the Inventory</h2>

<p>Clicking on the "Add New Vehicle" button will take the user to a form to add a new vehicle. It's as simple as adding in all of the info and pressing "Add Car".</p>

<h2>Editing the Inventory</h2>

<p>Once the vehicle has been added, it can be viewed with the other vehicle in the inventory. The vehicle can be deleted by a logged in user, as well as edited with a form similar to the "add" form.</p>

<h3>Dynamic Layout</h3>
<p>The app also works well on mobile.</p>
